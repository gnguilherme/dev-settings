Settings for improve dev experience


## VSCode settings
### `settings`
- `User` - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
- `Workspace` - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.

Look at the .vscode/settings.json for the configurations

> [!WARNING]  
> Workspace settings are specific to a project and override user settings.
